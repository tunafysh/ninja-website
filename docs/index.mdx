Welcome to Ninja — documentation for the Shuriken-based service manager.

Ninja manages services packaged as "shurikens": self-contained, versioned service bundles that include metadata, management scripts, configuration templates and optional tools. This site is organized to help end users install and run shurikens, and to help developers extend and package services for distribution.

- Quickstart: Getting up and running with a shuriken
- User Guide: Day-to-day usage and the Armory
- Developer Guide: Building shurikens, the DSL and testing
- Reference: Manifest fields, CLI and API details

Start with the [Getting Started](getting-started/quickstart.mdx) guide for a minimal, runnable example.
