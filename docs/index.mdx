## What is a Shuriken?

A shuriken is a packaged service distributed as a `.shuriken` file containing:

- **Metadata** - Name, version, platform, and description
- **Management** - Start/stop logic (script or native binary)
- **Configuration** - Templates and user options
- **Tools** - Optional executable scripts
- **Lifecycle hooks** - Post-install and other scripts

## Key Features

- **Flexible management** - Script-based or native binary control
- **Template-based config** - Tera templates with user options
- **Process safety** - PID + start time verification
- **Scriptable** - Lua API and DSL for automation
