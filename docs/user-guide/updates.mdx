title: Updating Ninja
---

This page explains how to update the Ninja application and installed shurikens.

Updating the application
 - Releases: release metadata (used by updater tooling) is generated by `version.py` and references packaged artifacts (AppImage, installers, tarballs). The project publishes platform-specific artifacts with accompanying signatures.
 - GUI updater: the GUI uses the release metadata to determine the latest version and present updates. Follow the GUI prompts or install the released artifact for your platform.

Updating installed shurikens
 - To upgrade a shuriken install: obtain the newer `.shuriken` package and install it (GUI or `shurikenctl install <path>`). The manager's `install` logic validates metadata and replaces the extracted files.
 - Backup before upgrade: use the backup/restore commands (`backup_now`, `backup_restore` in the GUI / Tauri commands) to create and restore backups of shuriken state and project files.

Packaging your own release
 - Use `shurikenctl forge` (or the `ShurikenManager::forge` API) to create a `.shuriken` package. `forge` serializes `ArmoryMetadata` as CBOR, packages the source tree as tar.gz, computes a SHA-256 signature, and writes the final file to the `blacksmith` directory.

Verifying packages
 - The manager reads magic bytes, metadata length, CBOR metadata, archive length, and archive before verifying the appended 32-byte SHA-256 signature. If verification fails the install is aborted.

If you need help
 - Check the GUI logs and the shuriken-specific logs. Use `shurikenctl list` to verify installed versions and `shurikenctl remove <name>` to rollback by uninstalling then reinstalling an older `.shuriken` package.
