title: Armory Guide
---

The Armory is where you browse, inspect, and install distributable shurikens (.shuriken packages).

Use the GUI to browse remote or local packages, preview metadata, and install with a single click. Each item in the Armory is backed by the project's `ArmoryMetadata` (name, id, platform, version, synopsis, description, authors, license, optional `postinstall`), which the app reads from the `.shuriken` package when you open it.

Installing
 - GUI: click **Install local file** and select a `.shuriken` file. The GUI uses the `open_shuriken` and `install_shuriken` Tauri commands to validate the package and hand it to the `ShurikenManager` for installation.
 - CLI: use `shurikenctl install /path/to/package.shuriken` to install from the command line; the manager validates the package header, verifies the signature, extracts the archive, and writes files to `~/.ninja/shurikens/{name}/`.

What the installer does
 - Validates magic bytes and reads CBOR metadata from the package.
 - Verifies archive length and signature (SHA-256) before extracting the tar.gz payload.
 - Extracts files to the appropriate `~/.ninja/shurikens/{name}/` folder and writes `.ninja/manifest.toml` and `options.toml` where applicable.
 - Runs a `postinstall` script when the metadata includes one.

Working with Armory items
 - Preview metadata: the GUI shows synopsis, description, authors, license, supported platforms and checksum.
 - Install/uninstall: installed state is tracked in the manager; use `shurikenctl remove <name>` to uninstall.
 - Upgrading: install a newer `.shuriken` package (same id, higher version) to upgrade; the manager will extract the new files.

Developer notes
 - Create distributable packages with the `forge` API or `shurikenctl forge` command. `forge` serializes `ArmoryMetadata` as CBOR, packs a tar.gz archive of the source, appends sizes and a SHA-256 signature to produce a `.shuriken` file.
 - The GUI expects `ArmoryMetadata` fields (see `core::manager::ArmoryMetadata`) and will call `open_shuriken` to read metadata before install.
