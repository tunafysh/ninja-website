title: Syntax of the DSL
---

The Ninja DSL is a lightweight, shellscript-like command language used to perform quick operations and automation inside the runtime.

Common DSL constructs

- `start <shuriken>` — start a shuriken
- `stop <shuriken>` — stop a shuriken
- `configure <shuriken>` — render configuration
- `http start <port>` — start the local HTTP API on a given port
- `execute <script>` — execute a DSL snippet or file

Examples

```
start example-service
configure example-service
http start 8080
```

The GUI and link parser accept `shurikenctl://` style links that map into DSL commands (for example `shurikenctl://start?shuriken=example-service`), allowing quick integrations from external apps.
