title: API Reference
---

Ninja provides both an HTTP REST surface and a GraphQL API for controlling shurikens programmatically.

HTTP endpoints (examples)

- `GET /shurikens` — list shuriken names
- `GET /shurikens/states` — map of shuriken → state (running | idle)
- `POST /shurikens/:name/start` — start the named shuriken
- `POST /shurikens/:name/stop` — stop the named shuriken
- `POST /shurikens/:name/configure` — render and write the shuriken config

Example (start):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shurikens/example-service/start
```

GraphQL

The GraphQL API exposes mutations such as `startShuriken(name: String)` and `stopShuriken(name: String)`, as well as queries to list shurikens and states. Use this from clients that prefer a single endpoint and strongly-typed schema.

Running the API

Start the HTTP server locally via the CLI: `shurikenctl api --port 8080` and then call the endpoints shown above.
