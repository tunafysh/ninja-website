title: MCP integration
---

Ninja provides tools to integrate with an MCP (Model/Message Control Plane) environment via a tool router. The MCP integration exposes a set of callable tools that wrap manager operations.

- Common tools

- `start_shuriken` — start a shuriken by name
- `stop_shuriken` — stop a shuriken by name
- `restart_shuriken` — stop then start
- `shuriken_status` — list shurikens and optionally return states
- `dsl_execute` / `ninjascript_execute` — execute DSL or Ninja-script (Lua) scripts

Implementation notes

- Tools are implemented with `rmcp` tool handlers and call into `ShurikenManager` methods.
- Tools accept JSON-serializable parameter structs (for example `{ name: "example-service" }`) and return `CallToolResult` values.

Use cases

- Remote control of services from orchestration systems
- Exposing shuriken lifecycle actions to higher-level automation
