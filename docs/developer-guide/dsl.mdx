title: Ninja DSL
---

The Ninja DSL is the interactive command language used by the runtime and GUI to perform management tasks. It is implemented as a thin command layer that maps user-facing verbs (start, stop, configure, http) to manager operations.

Programmatic usage

- `DslContext` is available from the `ShurikenManager` and provides the execution context used by the GUI and link parser.
- The function `execute_commands(&ctx, cmd)` runs a DSL command string and returns output or errors.

Examples

```text
start example-service
configure example-service
http start 8080
```

The DSL is intended for orchestration and short automation snippets. For complex logic, prefer management scripts inside the shuriken (Lua `.ns`) or external orchestration tools.
