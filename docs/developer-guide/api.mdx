title: API
---

The API exposes programmatic access to the Armory and shuriken lifecycle.

Common endpoints / interfaces:

- Install / uninstall a shuriken
- Start / stop / restart services
- Query status and list installed shurikens
- Run shuriken-defined tools

See the project's API server and query modules (HTTP handlers and GraphQL resolvers) in the source repository for concrete route implementations.
