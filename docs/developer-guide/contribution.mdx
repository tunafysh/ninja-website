Thank you for considering a contribution. This document covers the high-level workflow for contributing to the project.

Repository layout (important folders)

- `core/` — runtime and manager logic
- `CLI/` — `shurikenctl` command implementation
- `API/` — HTTP and GraphQL API server
- `GUI/` — desktop GUI (Tauri + web frontend)
- `docs/` — documentation source

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your work.
2. Run tests and linters locally before opening a pull request.

Commands to run locally

```bash
# install node dependencies for GUI (if editing frontend)
pnpm install

# run Rust tests and build
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Pull request notes

- Keep changes focused and small where possible.
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Describe your change and why it is needed in the PR description.

Coding style

- Follow existing module patterns and naming conventions.
- Avoid large refactors without prior discussion.

If you need help, open an issue first to discuss the planned change.
