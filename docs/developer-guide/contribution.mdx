Guidelines for contributing to the Ninja project.

## Getting Started

### Repository Structure

```
ninja/
├── core/          # Runtime and manager logic
├── CLI/           # shurikenctl command-line tool
├── HTTP/          # REST API server
├── GUI/           # Tauri desktop application
├── MCP/           # Model Context Protocol tools
├── FFI/           # Foreign function interface
└── tests/         # Integration tests
```

### Development Setup

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja.git
cd ninja
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
# Rust toolchain (required)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Node.js and pnpm (for GUI)
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh

# GUI dependencies
cd GUI
pnpm install
```

**3. Build the project**

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Build release
cargo build --release

# Build GUI
cd GUI
pnpm tauri build
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

Follow existing code patterns and conventions:

- Use Rust idioms and best practices
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific tests
cargo test -p core

# Build and test CLI
cargo build -p CLI --release
./target/release/shurikenctl --version

# Test GUI
cd GUI
pnpm tauri dev
```

### 4. Lint and Format

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

- Write a clear PR title and description
- Reference related issues
- Explain what changed and why
- Include test results if applicable

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- Fix all `clippy` warnings
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

```rust
/// Starts a shuriken service by name.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `name` - The shuriken identifier
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` on success
/// * `Err(NinjaError)` on failure
pub async fn start(&self, name: &str) -> Result<(), NinjaError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:

```
feat: add support for platform-specific configuration
fix: resolve race condition in process spawning
docs: update installation guide
test: add integration tests for shuriken manager
refactor: simplify configuration templating
```

### Documentation

- Update relevant `.mdx` files for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include examples in API documentation

## Testing Requirements

### New Features

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Test both success and error cases

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_new_feature() {
    // Test implementation
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_new_feature_error_case() {
    // Test error handling
}
```

### Bug Fixes

- Add regression tests to prevent reoccurrence
- Verify the fix resolves the original issue

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] Code builds without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for changes
