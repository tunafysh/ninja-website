title: Testing Ninja
---

Testing strategy

- Unit tests: run `cargo test` in Rust crates (core, CLI, API, etc.) to validate logic.
- Integration tests: exercise the `ShurikenManager` (start/configure/stop) against temporary shuriken directories.
- Script tests: exercise `.ns` management scripts using the runtime engine API (execute functions and assert side-effects).

Quick checks

```bash
# run unit tests
cargo test --workspace

# build and run the CLI for manual integration checks
cargo build -p CLI --release
./target/release/shurikenctl list
```

Tips

- Use temporary directories for shuriken fixtures to avoid polluting `~/.ninja`.
- Test both native and script-managed shurikens when possible.
- Mock or stub external side effects (network, systemctl) in unit tests.
