High-level architecture

- The **Armory** stores and publishes `.shuriken` packages.
- The **Ninja runtime** executes management logic: installs, configures, starts and stops shurikens.
- **Shurikens** are self-contained bundles with `.ninja/manifest.toml`, templates and scripts.
- **DSL / scripting engine** runs shuriken scripts for custom management logic.

See the project's source code (manager, shuriken, CLI, etc.) for implementation examples and query logic.
