Installation options

1) Prebuilt binary

- Download the appropriate release for your platform from the project releases page and unpack it.
-- Move the `shurikenctl` binary to a directory on your `PATH` (for example `/usr/local/bin`).

2) Package manager (where available)

- On platforms that provide packages, prefer the native package for easier upgrades and service integration.

3) Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja.git
cd ninja
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/shurikenctl /usr/local/bin/
```

After installation, check basic health:

```bash
shurikenctl --version
shurikenctl help
```

Publishing releases (recommended)

If you distribute prebuilt artifacts, publish them via the project's GitHub **Releases** page and follow these best practices:

- Attach platform-specific artifacts (AppImage, installers, tarballs) and their corresponding signature/checksum files (e.g. `.sig`, `.sha256`).
- Add short release notes or a changelog summarizing user-facing changes.
- Clearly label platforms and versions so users can pick the correct artifact.

This makes it easy for users to verify artifacts and keeps installation links and documentation accurate.

If you rely on system-level service management for long-running operation, create a systemd unit or equivalent to manage the `shurikenctl` process.
