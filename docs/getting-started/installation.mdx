## Installation Options

### 1. Prebuilt Binary (Recommended)

**Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja/releases) for stability.** This is the recommended method and may be the only time you need to manually download—Ninja can update itself.

```bash
# Extract and move to PATH
tar -xzf shurikenctl-*.tar.gz
sudo mv shurikenctl /usr/local/bin/
```

**Note:** Ninja includes self-update functionality, so future updates can be managed through the application itself.

### 2. Package Manager

Use your platform's package manager where available (check [releases](https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja/releases) for platform-specific packages).

### 3. Build from Source

For development or testing the latest changes. For production use, prefer prebuilt releases.

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja.git
cd ninja
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/shurikenctl /usr/local/bin/
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
shurikenctl --version
shurikenctl help
```
