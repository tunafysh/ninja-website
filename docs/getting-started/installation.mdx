Installation options

1) Prebuilt binary

- Download the appropriate release for your platform from the project releases page and unpack it.
-- Move the `shurikenctl` binary to a directory on your `PATH` (for example `/usr/local/bin`).

2) Package manager (where available)

- On platforms that provide packages, prefer the native package for easier upgrades and service integration.

3) Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja.git
cd ninja
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/shurikenctl /usr/local/bin/
```

After installation, check basic health:

```bash
shurikenctl --version
shurikenctl help
```

If you rely on system-level service management for long-running operation, create a systemd unit or equivalent to manage the `shurikenctl` process.
