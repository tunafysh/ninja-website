Common troubleshooting steps

1) Service won't start

- Check `.ninja/shuriken.lck` for PID and start time
- Inspect logs (path defined in `manifest.toml` under `[logs].log-path`)
- Run the service binary/script manually to reproduce errors

2) Configuration not applied

 - Ensure `.ninja/config.tmpl` exists and variables referenced exist in `options.toml`
 - Run `shurikenctl configure <name>` and inspect rendered output

3) Installation problems

- Verify permissions for destination directories
- Check that the `.shuriken` package is valid and for correct platform

4) If state appears inconsistent

 - Use `shurikenctl stop <name>` then confirm process termination and remove stale lock files if necessary

When in doubt, enable verbose logging and consult the shuriken's `postinstall` and management scripts to see what actions are being taken.
