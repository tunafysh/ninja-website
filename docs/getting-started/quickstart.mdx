title: Quickstart Guide
---

This quickstart shows the minimal steps to install a shuriken, configure it, and start the service.

1) Install Ninja (choose your platform method — binary, package manager or build from source). Example (build from source):

```bash
# build from source (example)
git clone https://github.com/tunafysh/ninja.git
cd ninja
cargo build --release
# copy the CLI binary to a PATH location
sudo cp target/release/shurikenctl /usr/local/bin/
```

2) Install a shuriken

```bash
# install a .shuriken package
shurikenctl install ./blacksmith/com.example.service-linux-x86_64.shuriken
```

3) Configure (if required)

```bash
# edit ~/.ninja/shurikens/example-service/.ninja/options.toml
shurikenctl configure example-service
```

4) Start and check status

```bash
shurikenctl start example-service
shurikenctl list
```

That's it — the service should be running. See the User Guide and Reference for details on packaging, manifest fields and management types.
